# Neural-Network (THIS PROJECT IS A WIP; THIS REPO IS SO I CAN MOVE CODE AROUND)
This project is an attempt to teach myself the inner workings of simple neural networks
## Current Status
- The network is free of memory issues
- The network can be trained to do binary operators correctly
- The MNIST set still aludes me. Will work on tweeking things till I get it
  - The current setup takes a little over 2 hours to run through the MNIST data
